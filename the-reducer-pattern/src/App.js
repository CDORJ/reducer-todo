// "The first and most important thing to understand about a reducer is that it will always only return one value. The job of a reducer is to reduce. That one value can be a number, a string, an array or an object, but it will always only be one. Reducers are really great for a lot of things, but theyâ€™re especially useful for applying a bit of logic to a group of values and ending up with another single result." "
